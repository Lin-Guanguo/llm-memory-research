# LLM Memory Research

A personal research project for studying and experimenting with LLM memory implementations.

## Overview

This repository explores how large language models can maintain long-term memory, enabling more personalized and context-aware AI interactions.

## Included Projects

### [mem0](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0)

The memory layer for personalized AI. Mem0 provides intelligent memory capabilities that help AI systems remember user preferences, past interactions, and contextual information.

Key features:
- Long-term memory for AI agents
- Semantic memory extraction and retrieval
- Multi-level memory (user, session, agent)

### [Letta](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta)

Letta (formerly MemGPT) is a framework for creating LLM agents with long-term memory and the ability to manage their own context.

Key features:
- Self-editing memory for extended context
- Stateful agents with persistent memory
- Tool use and function calling

## Setup

```bash
# Clone with submodules
git clone --recursive <repo-url>

# Or initialize submodules after clone
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
